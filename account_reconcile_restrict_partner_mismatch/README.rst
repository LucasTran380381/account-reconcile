This module restricts reconciliation between journal items when:

   - both items have different partners
   - one item is with partner and the other without it

This rule applies only for journal items using receivable and payable
account type.

As at the moment of installation some journal items could have been
reconciled using different partners, you can detect them in menu
Accounting > Adviser > Reconciled items with partner mismatch.

This restriction can be enabled per company but can also be deactivated
per journal.
